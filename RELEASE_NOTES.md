# Release Notes - v1.0.0: The Bikeshedding Begins

## 🎭 Introducing Bikeshed Bot: Your PR's New Worst Best Friend

Today marks the dawn of a new era in code review automation. We're thrilled to unleash upon the world a GitHub Action so powerful, so thorough, that it will find discussion points in even the most pristine pull requests.

### 🔥 Features That Will Keep You Up at Night

#### 🤖 **Relentless Code Commentary**
- Discovers "opportunities for discussion" in EVERY pull request
- Guaranteed minimum concern generation (configurable, because we're generous)
- Random severity assignment to keep things spicy
- Multiple comment styles: friendly (with emojis!), formal (for the suits), or constructive (our personal favorite)

#### 📅 **Meeting Scheduler of Doom**
- Automatically schedules up to 180-minute meetings about variable naming
- 240-minute deep dives into your architectural choices
- Strategic timing algorithms that somehow always pick your lunch hour
- Google Calendar integration that will fill your schedule faster than you can say "bikeshed"

#### 🏷️ **Label Proliferation Engine**
- Adds `needs-discussion` to everything
- Priority labels ranging from `priority-critical` to `priority-worth-noting`
- Special `bikeshed-review` label so everyone knows what happened here

### 😈 Diabolical Highlights

- **TODO Detection**: Found a TODO comment? That's a 180-minute "technical debt planning session" right there
- **Test File Analysis**: Test files get special scrutiny with "test coverage approach" discussions
- **The Randomizer**: Uses advanced RNG to ensure no two reviews are alike
- **Concern Amplification**: Not enough natural concerns? We'll manufacture some about your "overall approach"

### 🎲 Configuration Options (Choose Your Adventure)

```yaml
min-concerns: 1  # Set to 10 for maximum chaos
max-meetings-per-pr: 3  # The sky's the limit
comment-style: 'friendly'  # Lull them into false security
use-emojis: true  # Because nothing says "serious code review" like 🤖
```

          enable-calendar: true  # RIP your calendar
```

### 📊 Statistics We're Proud Of

### 🎪 Installation Celebration

- 🎉 Unlimited concern generation for all users
- 🎊 Free priority labeling on every PR
- 🎈 Complimentary 3-hour onboarding meetings (automatically scheduled)

### 💌 Final Words

Remember: It's not about the code quality, it's about the meetings we schedule along the way.

May your PRs be forever discussed, your calendars perpetually full, and your variable names eternally questioned.
